# Java-game
This was the final project I had to do for my lower-level programming class, ITEC 220 

It's a very simple game featuring Java Slick and graphics. I wanted to make a game based on my favorite book series as a teenager so I chose to do it based on the Maximum Ride series by James Patterson.

The characters are copywritten as follows: 

Max (person the user controls)

Flying warewolf creature (the obstacle)

Angel (the object that Max has to get to)

I TAKE NO CREDIT FOR THIS ARTWORK

However...

The background and buttons of this game are all copywritten to me as I made them from scratch.
